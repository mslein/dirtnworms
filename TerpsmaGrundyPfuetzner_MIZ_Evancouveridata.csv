Location,"Site X: Bamfield Marine Sciences Center South docks (48.83348°N, 125.13687°W) - East side of inlet
Site Y: Island Health Nurse’s Dock (48.82712°N, 125.13730°W) - East side of inlet
Site Z: West Government docks (48.82912°N, 125.14008°W) - West side of inlet
All sites are within the Bamfield Inlet",,,,,,,,,
Timeframe,July 20th to 26th 2024,,,,,,,,,
Collection Method,"Tube worms were gently peeled away from hummocks on lines hanging off the docks or the wood of the 
docks by hand to keep the tube and the worm intact and placed in a bucket with seawater to be transported 
back to the lab: The lines were kept out of the water for a maximum of 5 minutes and the water in the bucket 
was refreshed every 15 minutes",,,,,,,,,
Data description:,,,,,,,,,,
Dependent Variables,Re-emergence time,,,,,,,,,
Independent Variable,Turbidity,,,,,,,,,
Observational Unit,Time taken for worm to fully retract and time taken to fully re-emerge,,,,,,,,,
Replicates,"41 replicates for group A, 45 replicates for group B, 38 replicates for group D",,,,,,,,,
Data in columns:,,,,,,,,,,
Worm ID,"Code assigned to wach worm to specify its collection location, experimental group, and individual number",,,,,,,,,
Tube Length,Measured length of the tube in centimeters using a measuring tape,,,,,,,,,
Tube Diameter,Measured diameter of the opening of the tube in centimeters using a caliper,,,,,,,,,
Trial,The day on which the experiment took place,,,,,,,,,
CR_Time,The time in the video when all radioles of the worm are completely hidden within the tube of the worm: No radioles remain outside of the tube,,,,,,,,,
PR_Time,"The time in the video when radioles were retracted, but not completely within the tube (some are still visible)",,,,,,,,,
CE_Time,The time in the video when the entirety of the radioles have been re-exposed after retraction,,,,,,,,,
PE_Time,The time in the video when a partial amount of the radioles have been re-exposed after retraction,,,,,,,,,
HI,Worm was retracted in tube at the beginning of trials,,,,,,,,,
EX,Worm did not retract in response to stimuli at the beginning of the trial,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Data in rows: ,Each worm is recorded in it's own row including all data in columns ,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Notes:,"If more than 10 minutes were taken for an individual to re-emerge, they were assigned a time of 600 seconds
All worms were disturbed during testing, whether they were exposed or not. Specimens X4, X24, and X29 
were excluded as they were found to be a different species. ",,,,,,,,,
